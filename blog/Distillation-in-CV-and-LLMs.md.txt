# Distillation in CV and LLMs

Yes, there are key similarities between distillation in computer vision and LLMs, though the implementations differ:
Common principles:

Knowledge transfer from larger "teacher" models to smaller "student" models
Preservation of important model behaviors while reducing computational costs
Use of soft labels/probabilities rather than hard classifications

Key differences:

CV distillation typically focuses on intermediate feature representations and specific spatial patterns
LLM distillation often involves matching output token probabilities and attention patterns across sequences
CV student models can more directly mimic spatial feature hierarchies, while LLM students must compress complex language patterns

The core concept remains consistent: transferring knowledge from larger to smaller models while maintaining performance. This allows deployment of more efficient models in production environments.
