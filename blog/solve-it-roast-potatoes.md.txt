# Solve It Roast Potatoes - created with iterative refinement with AI

This started off as a bit of fun. I worked with an AI Assistant using dialogue engineering and iterative refinement to create a receipe for very tasty roast potatoes prepared a day in advance, so that I can just reheat them. The family thought these were the most tasty roast potatoes they had ever had. Note these where much better than my ChatGPT roast potatoes I tried a couple of months ago.

## Ingredients:

* 1.5kg all-rounder potatoes
* ½ cup oil or goose fat
* 2 tablespoons salt (for water)
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* Optional: garlic cloves, rosemary, thyme


## Day 1 - Preparation:

Baking soda: Add 1/2 teaspoon to the parboiling water. It breaks down the exterior of the potatoes more effectively, creating a better surface for crisping.

For 1.5kg potatoes, use 2 tablespoons of salt

* In about 2 liters (8 cups) of water
* Plus the 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

The ratio is important because:

* Salt helps break down the potato surface
* Helps season from the inside out
* Works with the baking soda for better crust formation

Par-boiling:

* Peel and cut about 1.5kg of potatoes into evenly-sized chunks (about 2 inches each)
* Par-boil them in salted water until they're just starting to soften at the edges (about 8-10 minutes)

After par-boiling, here's the crucial step for extra crispiness:

* Drain the potatoes in a colander
* Put the lid on the colander and give them a gentle shake to roughen up the edges - this creates more surface area for crispiness
* Let them steam dry for about 5 minutes

While they're drying, we need to prepare the roasting tray. 

For the oil preparation:

* Pour a generous layer of oil (about 1/2 cup) into your roasting tray - goose fat or vegetable oil work well
* Add a few whole garlic cloves and some fresh rosemary if you like
* Put the tray in the oven at 200°C (400°F) for about 5 minutes until the oil is really hot

Here's how to roast them:

* Carefully add the potatoes to the hot oil (they might spit!)
* Turn them to coat in the oil
* Roast for about 40-45 minutes, turning them every 15 minutes
* They're done when golden brown and crispy

To make them even tastier, during the initial roasting:

* Add whole, unpeeled garlic cloves to the oil
* Toss in fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, or sage work beautifully)
* Season with sea salt and black pepper
* A few tablespoons of semolina when shaking can make them even crispier

For storing and reheating:

* Let them cool completely on a wire rack (this prevents them getting soggy)
* Store in an airtight container in the fridge

## Day 2 - Reheating:

Just before serving:

* Sprinkle with Maldon salt flakes
* Add finely chopped fresh parsley
* A light dusting of smoked paprika

### Oven

Here's the oven reheating method:

* Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F)
* Spread potatoes on a baking tray (don't overcrowd them)
* Add a light drizzle of oil or goose fat
* Reheat for 15-20 minutes until hot and crispy

### Air fryer

* Preheat air fryer to 180°C (350°F)
* Place potatoes in the basket in a single layer
* Spray or brush very lightly with oil
* Heat for 8-10 minutes, shaking halfway through


## Food science

### Baking soda

The baking soda works through some interesting food chemistry:

* It raises the pH of the water, making it more alkaline
* This alkaline environment breaks down the pectin (a fiber) on the surface of the potatoes
* The broken-down exterior creates a starchy "slurry" coating
* When roasted, this coating turns into an extra-crispy shell while keeping the inside fluffy
* This is similar to what happens when making pretzels - the alkaline bath is what gives them their distinctive crust!

### Temperature control: 

* Starting with hot oil (200°C/400°F) creates immediate surface dehydration
* This forms a moisture barrier, keeping the insides steamy and fluffy

### Potato chemistry:

* Higher starch potatoes (like Maris Piper or Russet) create fluffier interiors
* They have less moisture content and more amylose (type of starch)

### Surface area optimization:

* Rough edges create more surface area for browning
* More surface area means more Maillard reaction (the chemical reaction between amino acids and sugars that creates golden-brown color and complex flavors)

### Steam management:

* Don't overcrowd the pan - each potato needs space
* Crowding creates steam, which prevents browning and crispiness
* Steam is the enemy of the Maillard reaction

### Reheating in an air fryer helps with the Maillard reaction:

The air fryer is excellent for the Maillard reaction during reheating because:

* Rapid air circulation removes surface moisture quickly
* The intense, even heat (around 180°C/350°F) is perfect for Maillard reactions
* The confined space helps maintain the high temperature needed
* The food is elevated, so steam can escape from all sides
* This is why air fryers often give better results than conventional ovens when reheating - they create the ideal conditions for continuing the Maillard reaction without making the potatoes soggy.

Here's how to optimize your air fryer for reheating roast potatoes:

### Temperature settings:

* Start at 180°C/350°F for the first 5 minutes
* Can increase to 200°C/400°F for the final 2-3 minutes for extra crispiness

### Loading technique:

* Single layer only
* Leave small gaps between potatoes
* Shake basket at halfway point

### Adjusting these settings based on potato size or quantity.

For larger potato chunks (>2 inches):

* Extend initial heating time to 7 minutes
* Keep at 180°C/350°F longer before increasing temperature
* May need 12-13 minutes total

For smaller chunks (<1.5 inches):

* Reduce initial time to 4 minutes
* Can go to higher temperature sooner
* Total time around 7-8 minutes

For multiple batches:

* Keep first batch warm in oven at 140°C/285°F
* Second batch might cook slightly faster as fryer is fully heated

### Common problems

If potatoes are soggy:

* Air fryer basket might be overcrowded
* Temperature might be too low
* They might not have cooled properly before refrigeration

If potatoes are dry inside:

* Reheating temperature might be too high
* Cooking time might be too long
* Light spray of oil before reheating can help

If browning is uneven:

* Basket might need more shaking
* Pieces might be different sizes
* Some pieces might be touching

### The optimal size and shape for a roast potato

Here's the science behind optimal potato dimensions.

Heat distribution physics:

* 2-2.5 inches allows heat to reach the center before the outside burns
* This size creates the ideal temperature gradient from surface to center
* Heat takes about 15-20 minutes to reach the core at 200°C, matching perfect crisping time

Surface area efficiency:

* Angular cuts create more edges for Maillard reaction
* Irregular surfaces provide better oil contact points
* More corners = more crispy bits (everyone's favorite part!)

### How irregular surfaces provide better oil contact points

Surface tension effects:

* Oil naturally collects in corners and crevices due to capillary action
* Rough surfaces create microscopic "pools" where oil can gather
* These oil-collecting points become intense heat transfer zones

Contact dynamics:

* When you shake the potatoes, irregular surfaces create multiple new contact points
* Each turn exposes different angles to the hot oil
* Rough surfaces have tiny peaks and valleys that hold oil even when turned

### How many shakes of the potatoes is optimal

For optimal potato shaking, here's the recommended approach:

Initial shake after par-boiling:

* 3-4 gentle shakes with the lid on
* You want to rough up the surface without breaking the potatoes
* Stop when you see a slight floury coating forming

During roasting:

* Turn/shake every 15 minutes (so 2-3 times total)
* Each shake should be gentle but thorough
* Ensure each potato has changed position

### Salt water ratio

Salt ratio (2 tablespoons per 2 liters) is optimal:

Osmotic pressure effects:

* Creates water that's about 3% salinity
* Strong enough to penetrate potato cells
* Not so strong that it draws too much moisture out
* Balances with internal potato chemistry

Chemical interaction:

* Works synergistically with baking soda
* Helps maintain alkaline environment
* Strengthens the breakdown of pectin
* Enhances starch gelatinization at surface

### Optimal basting technique

Timing:

* Baste every 15-20 minutes
* Always after turning potatoes
* More frequently in last 15 minutes
* Let oil settle 30 seconds after each turn before basting

Technique:

* Collect oil from corners of pan where it pools
* Squeeze baster gently for even distribution
* Target the drier looking areas
* Aim for edges and corners of potatoes
